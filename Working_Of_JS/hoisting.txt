Variables are lifted to the top of their scope

Before execution , code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable,
a new property is created in the variable environment object.

Function : Function declaration can be used before the code is executed, so it can be called from anywhere
function declaration is block scoped, only when the strict mode is used, it is not strict in sloppy mode

Var : var variable can't be accessed before it is declared, but no error will come just comes as undefined

let & const: let & const and not hoisted, meaning no initialization is done for let& const
const variable can't be accessed before it is declaredL. they are block scoped

function expression & arrows : 

Temporal Dead Zone: the code where the variable is tried to access even though it is not present is
called Temporal Dead Zone.
